# la-robot-cafe
We’ve decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles.

This project is promising but expensive, so me and my partners decided to try to attract investors. They’re interested in the current market conditions but will we be able to maintain our success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off? I'm an analytics guru, so my partners have asked me to prepare some market research. I have have open-source data on restaurants in LA.
