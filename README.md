# la-robot-cafe
A client decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles.

This project is promising but expensive, I was asked to help attract investors. Theyâ€™re interested in the current market conditions but will it be able to maintain our success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off? As an analytics guru, I was asked to prepare some market research. I have have open-source data on restaurants in LA.
